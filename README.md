Magento_ABTesting
=================

AB (or split-testing) Magento websites using Themes and Optimizely. Modified from the Creare version which used Google Analytics accounts for tracking. 

Compatible with 1.7+ Magento CE

For a full break-down of the original module please visit the supporting blog post: <a href="https://www.creare.co.uk/ab-split-testing-magento-with-google-analytics-cro">https://www.creare.co.uk/ab-split-testing-magento-with-google-analytics-cro</a>

<h2>The Theory</h2>

What we have here is an extension that will serve up 50% of users to one theme, and 50% of users to another theme - using cookies.

In the admin section we have the ability to add specific Optimizely experiment and variation IDs to each of these themes.
